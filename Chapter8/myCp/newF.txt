Is your name Marty McFly ?
I've got something for you.
A letter.
A letter for me ?
That's impossible.
- Who the hell are you ?
- Western Union.
Many of us at the office were hoping
you could shed some light on the subject.
We've had that envelope
in our possession...
for the past 70 years.
It was given to us
with the explicit instructions...
that it be delivered
to a young man with your description...
answering to the name of Marty
at this exact location...
at this exact minute, November 12, 1955.
We had a bet going on whether this Marty
would actually be here.
Looks like I lost.
Did you say 70 years ?
Yes. 70 years, 2 months, 12 days,
to be exact. Sign on line 6, please.
Here you are.
It's from the Doc !
"Dear Marty,
if my calculations are correct...
"you will receive this letter immediately
after the DeLorean's struck by lightning.
"First let me assure you
I'm alive and well.
"I've been living happily
these past 8 months in the year 1885.
"The lightning bolt...
"September, 1885."
Wait, kid !
Wait a minute. What's this all about ?
He's alive !
The Doc's alive !
- He's in the Old West, but he's alive.
- Kid, you all right ?
Need any help ?
There's only one man who can help me.
Relax, Doc. It's me.
It's me ! It's Marty.
Impossible.
I sent you back to the future.
I know, you did send me back...
but I'm back.
I'm back from the future.
Great Scott !
Doc, Doc, wake up!
TO BE CONTINUED...

That's right, Tannen !
Come on, runt !
You can dance better than that !
